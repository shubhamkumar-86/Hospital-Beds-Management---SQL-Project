#  DAY 12. Practice Questions

# 1. Find all weeks in services_weekly where no special event occurred.
SELECT week, event FROM services_weekly
WHERE event IS NULL OR event = 'none';

# 2. Count how many records have null or empty event values.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_empty_value_count
FROM services_weekly
WHERE event is NULL OR event = 'none' OR event = ''

# 3. List all services that had at least one week with a special event.

SELECT DISTINCT service
FROM services_weekly
WHERE event is NOT NULL AND event != 'none' AND event != ''



# DAY-12 DAILY CHALLENGE
# Analyze the event impact by comparing weeks with events vs weeks without events. Show: event status ('With Event' or 'No Event'),
# count of weeks, average patient satisfaction, and average staff morale. Order by average patient satisfaction descending.
