# Hospital-Beds-Management---SQL-Project

# 🏥 SQL 21-Day Hospital Dataset Challenge

This repository contains a **collection of synthetic hospital datasets** designed to simulate real-world operations in a **medium-sized hospital**.
It focuses on **staffing**, **patient admissions**, and **bed allocation** across various services — providing a realistic foundation for SQL learning and analytical case studies.

## 📊 About the Dataset

This dataset was created as part of the **21 Days SQL Challenge** organized by **Indian Data Club**, aimed at helping learners build strong analytical and business problem-solving skills using SQL.

It allows you to explore:

* Hospital resource distribution
* Personnel deployment and scheduling
* Patient demand trends
* Service-level performance and satisfaction metrics

| `staff_schedule.csv` | Weekly staff attendance and service assignment schedule                                                 |

## 🧠 Learning Goals

This dataset helps you practice both basic and advanced SQL concepts, including:

* Writing queries using `SELECT`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `CASE`
* Applying **subqueries**, **CTEs**, and **window functions**
* Performing **data aggregation** and **business analysis**
* Solving **real-world hospital management problems**
* Strengthening SQL skills for **data analyst interviews**
* Building confidence for **data analyst interviews and case studies**
 
## 💻 How to Use

1. Import the CSV files into your preferred SQL environment (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
2. Create tables matching the file structures:

   * `patients`
   * `services_weekly`
   * `staff`
   * `staff_schedule`
3. Run daily SQL challenges to strengthen analytical thinking.
4. Document your insights and SQL scripts in this repository

## 📅 Challenge Format

This dataset supports a **21-day SQL challenge** structure, where each day introduces a new business scenario — from basic queries to advanced joins, aggregations, and KPIs.

## 📚 Acknowledgment
